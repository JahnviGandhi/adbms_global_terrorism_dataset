This project was implemented for the course called Advance Database Management Systems.

In this project I have,

•	Analyzed the global terrorism database by implementing certain MapReduce Patterns including summarization, filtering and some of the complex patterns.
•	Represented the findings graphically, to comprehend the analysis and recognize patterns if existed.
